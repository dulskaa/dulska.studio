            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Hello, my name is Aleksandra Dulska, and I am a second-year master’s student in Design at the Eugeniusz Geppert Academy of Art and Design in Wrocław, Poland.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                My research focuses on user experience in the context of regional tourism development in Lower Silesia.
                The growing presence of Korean companies in this region has introduced  new cultural dynamics and everyday interactions between Korean and Polish communities.
                This evolving relationship forms the foundation of  my master’s thesis.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                In my study, I explore how citizens of the Republic of Korea perceive life and travel in Poland/Europe
                — how they experience their surroundings, and to what degree they find their time here positive, enjoyable, and meaningful.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                To investigate these topics, I am conducting in-depth interviews (IDI);
                individual conversations that encourage participants to share  personal experiences, perspectives, and reflections.
                This qualitative  approach allows me to gain a deeper understanding of life in Poland  through the eyes of Korean residents.

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                In-depth interviews (IDI) are a qualitative research  method based on one-on-one conversations.
                They aim to gather detailed,  personal insights about a participant’s experiences, opinions, and  perspectives.
                Unlike surveys, IDIs encourage open dialogue, allowing  participants to share stories and reflections in their own words.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                During the interview, I’ll ask open-ended questions about your experiences traveling in Poland and Europe
                — how you perceive these trips, what you enjoy most, and what challenges you’ve encountered along the way.
                There are no right or wrong answers — I’m interested in your honest perspective.
